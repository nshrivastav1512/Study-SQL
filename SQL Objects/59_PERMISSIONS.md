# SQL Deep Dive: Permissions (`GRANT`, `DENY`, `REVOKE`)

## 1. Introduction: Controlling Access with DCL

Data Control Language (DCL) is the subset of SQL used to manage access rights and permissions within the database. The three core DCL commands in SQL Server are:

1.  **`GRANT`:** Gives a specific permission to a principal (user, role, login).
2.  **`DENY`:** Explicitly prohibits a specific permission for a principal, overriding any grants.
3.  **`REVOKE`:** Removes a previously issued `GRANT` or `DENY`.

Properly managing permissions is fundamental to database security, ensuring users and applications can only perform authorized actions on specific objects or data.

**Key Concepts (Recap):**

*   **Principal:** The entity receiving or being denied permission (Login, User, Role).
*   **Securable:** The entity on which permission is being controlled (Server, Database, Schema, Table, View, Procedure, Column, etc.).
*   **Permission:** The specific action allowed or denied (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `EXECUTE`, `ALTER`, `CONTROL`, `CREATE TABLE`, `VIEW SERVER STATE`).
*   **Scope:** The level at which the permission applies (Server, Database, Schema, Object, Column).
*   **Precedence:** `DENY` overrides `GRANT`. Permissions are cumulative through role membership unless overridden by a `DENY`.

## 2. DCL Commands in Action: Analysis of `59_PERMISSIONS.sql`

This script provides practical examples of using `GRANT`, `DENY`, and `REVOKE`. *Note: Assumes the principals mentioned exist.*

**a) Granting Permissions (`GRANT`)**

```sql
-- Database Level
GRANT CREATE TABLE, CREATE VIEW TO HRDevelopers;
-- Schema Level
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON SCHEMA::HR TO HRUsers;
-- Object Level
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON HR.Departments TO DepartmentManagers;
-- Column Level
GRANT SELECT ON HR.Employees(EmployeeID, FirstName, ...) TO ReceptionStaff;
-- With Grant Option (Allow delegation)
GRANT SELECT ON HR.Departments TO HRManagers WITH GRANT OPTION;
-- Execute Permission
GRANT EXECUTE ON HR.AddEmployee TO HRClerks;
```

*   **Explanation:** Demonstrates granting various types of permissions (`CREATE TABLE`, `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `EXECUTE`) at different scopes (Database, Schema, Object, Column) `TO` specific database roles. Includes `WITH GRANT OPTION` allowing the grantee role (`HRManagers`) to further grant the `SELECT` permission on `HR.Departments`.

**b) Denying Permissions (`DENY`)**

```sql
-- Object Level
DENY DELETE ON HR.Employees TO HRClerks;
-- Schema Level
DENY ALTER ON SCHEMA::HR TO HRDevelopers;
-- Column Level
DENY SELECT ON HR.Employees(Salary, BankAccountNumber) TO HRClerks;
```

*   **Explanation:** Explicitly prohibits specific actions. `DENY DELETE` prevents `HRClerks` from deleting employees, even if they might inherit `DELETE` from another role. `DENY ALTER` prevents `HRDevelopers` from altering any object within the `HR` schema. `DENY SELECT` on specific columns prevents `HRClerks` from viewing sensitive data. Remember, `DENY` overrides `GRANT`.

**c) Revoking Permissions (`REVOKE`)**

```sql
-- Revoke a previous GRANT
REVOKE INSERT ON HR.Departments FROM DepartmentManagers;
-- Revoke a GRANT that had GRANT OPTION (requires CASCADE if re-granted)
REVOKE SELECT ON HR.Departments FROM HRManagers CASCADE;
-- Revoke a previous DENY
REVOKE DENY DELETE ON HR.Employees FROM HRClerks;
```

*   **Explanation:** Removes existing permission entries.
    *   `REVOKE ... FROM ...`: Used to remove a `GRANT`.
    *   `REVOKE ... FROM ... CASCADE`: Required to remove a `GRANT WITH GRANT OPTION` if the grantee has subsequently granted that permission to others. `CASCADE` removes the permission from the direct grantee *and* any principals they granted it to.
    *   `REVOKE DENY ... FROM ...`: Removes an explicit `DENY`. After this, the principal's effective permission depends on other grants or denies they might have directly or through roles. (Note: While `REVOKE ... TO ...` is sometimes seen for revoking DENY, `REVOKE ... FROM ...` generally works for both GRANT and DENY).

**d) Permission Inheritance and Scope Example**

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA Finance;
CREATE TABLE Finance.Budget (...);
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA::Finance TO FinanceAnalysts; -- Grant on Schema
GRANT UPDATE ON Finance.Budget TO BudgetAdministrators; -- Grant on Object
```

*   **Explanation:** Illustrates granting permissions at different scopes. `FinanceAnalysts` can `SELECT` from *any* object in the `Finance` schema (including `Finance.Budget` and future objects). `BudgetAdministrators` can only `UPDATE` the specific `Finance.Budget` table (unless granted other permissions elsewhere).

**e) Permissions for Special Principals (`public`, `guest`)**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON HR.Departments TO PUBLIC;
GRANT SELECT ON HR.EmployeeSkills TO GUEST;
```

*   **Explanation:**
    *   `public`: A built-in role that *every* user, login, and role belongs to. Granting permissions to `public` makes them available to everyone by default (unless overridden by a `DENY`). Generally, granting minimal permissions to `public` is preferred over granting broadly.
    *   `guest`: A special user account that exists in some databases (like `master`, `tempdb`, or user databases if explicitly enabled). It allows connections without a specific user mapping. Granting permissions to `guest` is generally discouraged for security reasons; explicit user mapping is preferred.

**f) Querying Permission Information (System Views & Functions)**

```sql
-- List all explicit permissions in the DB
SELECT pr.name AS Principal, perm.permission_name, perm.state_desc, ... FROM sys.database_principals pr JOIN sys.database_permissions perm ON ...;
-- List permissions for a specific principal
SELECT ... FROM sys.database_permissions perm JOIN sys.database_principals pr ON ... WHERE pr.name = 'HRClerks';
-- List permissions on a specific object
SELECT pr.name AS Principal, ..., perm.permission_name, ... FROM sys.database_permissions perm JOIN sys.database_principals pr ON ... WHERE perm.major_id = OBJECT_ID('HR.Employees');
-- List permissions on a specific schema
SELECT pr.name AS Principal, ..., perm.permission_name, ... FROM sys.database_permissions perm JOIN sys.database_principals pr ON ... WHERE perm.class = 3 AND perm.major_id = SCHEMA_ID('HR');
-- List EFFECTIVE permissions for the CURRENT user on the database
SELECT * FROM fn_my_permissions(NULL, 'DATABASE');
-- List EFFECTIVE permissions for the CURRENT user on a specific object
SELECT * FROM fn_my_permissions('HR.Employees', 'OBJECT');
```

*   **Explanation:** Uses `sys.database_principals` and `sys.database_permissions` to view explicitly granted or denied permissions. Uses the built-in function `fn_my_permissions` to view the *effective* permissions for the *current* user, taking into account role membership and inheritance (but not `DENY` overrides directly in its output, though they still apply).

## 3. Targeted Interview Questions (Based on `59_PERMISSIONS.sql`)

**Question 1:** What is the difference between `REVOKE SELECT ON MyTable FROM UserA;` and `DENY SELECT ON MyTable TO UserA;`?

**Solution 1:**

*   `REVOKE SELECT ON MyTable FROM UserA;`: Removes a specific prior `GRANT` or `DENY` for `SELECT` given directly to `UserA`. If `UserA` also inherits `SELECT` from a role, `REVOKE` doesn't affect that inheritance; the user might still be able to select.
*   `DENY SELECT ON MyTable TO UserA;`: Explicitly forbids `UserA` from selecting, regardless of any `GRANT` permissions they might have directly or inherit through roles. `DENY` always takes precedence.

**Question 2:** When would you need to use the `CASCADE` option with the `REVOKE` statement?

**Solution 2:** You need to use `CASCADE` when revoking a permission (e.g., `SELECT`) from a principal (`PrincipalA`) who was originally granted that permission `WITH GRANT OPTION`, *and* `PrincipalA` has subsequently granted that same permission to other principals (`PrincipalB`, `PrincipalC`). Using `REVOKE ... FROM PrincipalA CASCADE;` ensures that the permission is removed not only from `PrincipalA` but also from `PrincipalB`, `PrincipalC`, and anyone else down the grant chain originating from `PrincipalA`. Without `CASCADE`, the `REVOKE` statement would fail in this scenario.

## 4. Tricky Interview Questions (Easy to Hard)

1.  **[Easy]** Which DCL command explicitly prohibits a permission?
    *   **Answer:** `DENY`.
2.  **[Easy]** Which DCL command removes a previous `GRANT` or `DENY`?
    *   **Answer:** `REVOKE`.
3.  **[Medium]** If `UserA` is granted `SELECT` on `SchemaA` and denied `SELECT` on `SchemaA.Table1`, can `UserA` select from `SchemaA.Table2`?
    *   **Answer:** Yes. The `DENY` is specific to `SchemaA.Table1`. The `GRANT` on `SchemaA` still applies to other objects in the schema, like `SchemaA.Table2`.
4.  **[Medium]** What does `GRANT EXECUTE ON MyProcedure TO UserA;` allow UserA to do? Does it automatically grant permissions on tables accessed *inside* MyProcedure?
    *   **Answer:** It allows `UserA` to run (`EXECUTE`) the stored procedure `MyProcedure`. It does *not* automatically grant permissions on tables accessed inside the procedure *unless* ownership chaining applies (i.e., the procedure and the tables have the same owner). If ownership chaining applies, only `EXECUTE` permission is needed; otherwise, `UserA` would also need direct permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `UPDATE`) on the tables accessed within the procedure.
5.  **[Medium]** Can you `GRANT` or `DENY` permissions at the column level for `INSERT` or `DELETE` operations?
    *   **Answer:** No. `INSERT` and `DELETE` permissions apply only at the object (table/view) or schema level. Column-level permissions are only available for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, and `REFERENCES`.
6.  **[Medium]** What is the purpose of granting permissions `TO PUBLIC`? Why should this generally be avoided?
    *   **Answer:** Granting permissions `TO PUBLIC` makes that permission available to every user, role, and login in the database by default. It should generally be avoided because it violates the principle of least privilege; it's better to grant permissions only to the specific roles or users that require them. Granting to `PUBLIC` can create security vulnerabilities.
7.  **[Hard]** How can you view the *effective* permissions for a specific user (taking into account role memberships), not just the explicit grants/denies?
    *   **Answer:** Use the built-in function `sys.fn_my_permissions(securable, 'securable_class')` to see the effective permissions for the *current* user. To check for *another* user, you typically need `IMPERSONATE` permission on that user and execute the function within an `EXECUTE AS USER = 'OtherUser'` context. There isn't a simple query that perfectly resolves all role/group memberships and deny precedence for an arbitrary user directly from the metadata views alone.
8.  **[Hard]** What is the difference between `GRANT CONTROL ON SCHEMA::MySchema` and `ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON SCHEMA::MySchema`?
    *   **Answer:**
        *   `GRANT CONTROL ON SCHEMA::MySchema TO PrincipalB;`: Gives `PrincipalB` ownership-like *permissions* on the schema (can alter/drop objects within it, grant permissions on it), but `PrincipalB` does not become the actual *owner* recorded in the metadata. The original owner remains.
        *   `ALTER AUTHORIZATION ON SCHEMA::MySchema TO PrincipalB;`: Changes the actual *owner* of the schema to `PrincipalB` in the system metadata. The new owner (`PrincipalB`) implicitly gains `CONTROL` permissions.
9.  **[Hard]** If a login is disabled (`ALTER LOGIN ... DISABLE`), are the permissions granted to the corresponding database user still visible in `sys.database_permissions`?
    *   **Answer:** Yes. Disabling the login only prevents authentication at the server level. The database user principal and any permissions granted to it still exist within the database metadata and will be visible in `sys.database_permissions`. The permissions are simply unusable via direct login until the login is re-enabled (though the user could potentially still be impersonated via `EXECUTE AS`).
10. **[Hard/Tricky]** `UserA` is in `Role1`. `Role1` is in `Role2`. `Role2` is granted `SELECT` on `TableX`. `Role1` is denied `SELECT` on `TableX`. Can `UserA` select from `TableX`?
    *   **Answer:** No. `UserA` inherits permissions from both `Role1` and `Role2`. Since `Role1` has an explicit `DENY`, and `DENY` overrides `GRANT`, `UserA` is denied `SELECT` permission on `TableX`, even though they also inherit a `GRANT` via `Role2`.
