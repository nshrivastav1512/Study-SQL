## SQL Statements

### DDL (Data Definition Language)

#### Create

The `CREATE` statement is used to create databases, schemas, tables, indexes, views, stored procedures, triggers, and functions. For example, you can create a stored procedure as shown in [01_CREATE.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\01_CREATE.sql#L99).

- **Database**: [01_CREATE.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\01_CREATE.sql#L5)
- **Schema**: [01_CREATE.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\01_CREATE.sql#L11)
- **Table**: [01_CREATE.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\01_CREATE.sql#L19)
- **Stored Procedure**: [01_CREATE.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\01_CREATE.sql#L99)

#### Alter

The `ALTER` statement is used to modify existing database objects. This includes adding or dropping columns in a table, changing data types, and more.

- **Example**: [02_ALTER.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\02_ALTER.sql)

### DML (Data Manipulation Language)

DML statements are used for managing data within schema objects. These include `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT`.

- **Insert**: [03_INSERT.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\03_INSERT.sql)
- **Update**: [04_UPDATE.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\04_UPDATE.sql)
- **Delete**: [05_DELETE.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\05_DELETE.sql)

### TCL (Transaction Control Language)

TCL statements are used to manage transactions in the database. These include `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, and `SAVEPOINT`.

- **Example**: [06_TCL.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\06_TCL.sql)

## Dynamic Management Views

Dynamic Management Views (DMVs) provide server state information that can be used to monitor the health of a server instance, diagnose problems, and tune performance.

- **Example**: [95_DYNAMIC_MANAGEMENT_VIEWS.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\SQL%20Objects\95_DYNAMIC_MANAGEMENT_VIEWS.sql)

## Performance Monitoring

Performance monitoring involves tracking various metrics to ensure the SQL Server is running efficiently. This includes CPU usage, memory usage, and I/O performance.

- **Example**: [95_DYNAMIC_MANAGEMENT_VIEWS.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\SQL%20Objects\95_DYNAMIC_MANAGEMENT_VIEWS.sql#L20)

## Connection and Session Monitoring

Monitoring connections and sessions helps in understanding the current load on the server and identifying any blocking issues.

- **Example**: [95_DYNAMIC_MANAGEMENT_VIEWS.sql](c:\AI%20Use%20and%20Deveopment\Study%20SQL\SQL%20Objects\95_DYNAMIC_MANAGEMENT_VIEWS.sql#L150)
